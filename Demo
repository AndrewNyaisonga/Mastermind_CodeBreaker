WELCOME TO MASTERMIND GAME

HERE ARE THE RULE OF THE GAME

I will be the codeBreaker and you will be the codeMaker, So this should be easy for you. 
Make out combinations of colors and I will be guessing with as little guess as I can. 

I will give you the combination of numbers and a prompt asking you how many I got right 
The first prompt(White) is for how many I got right and in the right position 
Second prompt(Black) is for how many I got right but in the wrong position 


I am ready to read your mind
